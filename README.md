This repository contains the codes and the data used for producing the results of the paper. The codes are in form of of jupyter notebooks.

For each city we collected information of land surface properties from the [Google Eart Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/) and the population from the [EU JRC Global Human Settlement Layer](https://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/). 

In this repository we can find python notebooks and python scripts to run the main analysis for our results and the response to the reviwers.
